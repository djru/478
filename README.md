# What is 4-7-8
[4-7-8](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417.php) is a type of breathing that is used in mindfulness and relaxation exercises. It's extremely simple: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8 âŒ›

# Why did you build this?
I was looking for a timer that I could use to do 4-7-8 while doing mindfulness training, and there were no good ones online. So I made this in about 30 minutes...

# Is this a PWA I can use on iphone?
Yep.
